## Hii, I'm Aleksandra!

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a computer science and engineering student, a junior data engineer, and a full-time reader. Fixated on machine learning, data science, and data engineering.

I’m studying part-time at [AGH University of Science and Technology](https://www.agh.edu.pl/en) and [Warsaw University of Technology](https://eng.pw.edu.pl/). Here I share my personal and academic projects, along with my journey in programming and learning new technologies.
