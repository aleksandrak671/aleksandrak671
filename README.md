## Hii, I'm Aleksandra!
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an ambitious student passionate about machine learning, data science and data emgineering. I’m studying part-time at AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków and Warsaw University of Technology. Here I share my projects and my journey in programming and new technologies.
